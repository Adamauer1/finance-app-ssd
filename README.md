# **Finance App SSD**

This is the frontend and backend of the Finance App for the class SSD

## Setup

1. Install dependencies
   You will have to open a terminal for both the frontend and backend project then run the following command for both.

```bash
npm install
```

2. You will have to find your localhost ipv4 address that will be running the backend server. This will be added to the files where the axios functions are running to send and retrieve data with the backend. The default port is 3000.

```bash
ipconfig
```

## Start

In order for the project to work with the backend both the frontend and backend will need to be running.

Open a terminal for both frontend and backend and run these commands respectively.

```bash
npx expo start -c
```

```bash
node index.js
```

These will start up both the app and the server. Once they are both running use the QR code displayed in the frontend terminal to connect with the expo app on your phone.
